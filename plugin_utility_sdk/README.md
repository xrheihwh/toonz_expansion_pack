This is the utility plugin SDK for toonz. It consists of several header files and must be used with a wrapper to properly register and work with the low level COM like SDK.

Dwango intended you to be able to use this with C or C++, the 3 mandatory header files do not use things like references. While the official wrapper uses OpenCV, you don't have to. None of the core or utils pull in the OpenCV headers (Let alone the toonz application), you can use something else like gmic. What you'll find here is my own written C wrapper around the low level sdk and a few other wrappers and libs to show off how flexible the SDK truly is. So you can write your own wrapper or you can do this in C, the choice is completely up to you. The original sdk is under the 3-Clause BSD license, my stuff is under zlib. 

Tahoma2D and OpenToonz from toonz sources do show off a few additional utils not used by the wrapper. Its not part of this repo because its not a core part of the sdk. You can find the sources to wolf or dwango plugins [here](https://www.github.com/tahoma2d/tahoma2d_plugins) or under the opentoonz plugins repo.

In the wrapper_sdk directory contains all the necessary headers and sources for the C wrapper along with anything else created. Just run the Makefile to build. Later on I'll make a few example samples to show how to use it. You only require the OpenCV dev libraries if using the toonz wrapper. Anything else requires what it requires in the source.
